Displays product options as a table with selectable values.


== Description ==

This plugin requires [Simple Product Options for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/product-options-for-woocommerce/) plugin to display the configurations table.

It displays a table with configuration values.
The table has selectable cells. So the user can select the values.
The user can select only the available combinations of the values.
All the combinations are imported from a CSV file like this:
QS03308,20,"PA 6.6",0.20,50
QS03308,20,"PA 6.6",0.20,45
QS03308,20,"PA 6.6",0.21,60
QS03308,20,"PA 6.6",0.21,65

This plugin uses text field product options to save the selected values. 
So that the selected configuration is visible on the order info page and in the order confirmation emails.


How To Use It:
1. Install the Product Options plugin.
2. Create a product with options for the configurations table.
3. Import the configuration options from a .csv file.
